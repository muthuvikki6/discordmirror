         # To replace mentions of @roles, @users or #channels,
         # you have to replace their ids. For example:
         # 2:
         #    replace: "insert_role_id_to_replace_here"
         #    with: "insert_replaced_role_id_here"
         #    where: "everywhere"
   # You can create as many mirrors as you want, so that different
   # channels can be mirrored to different webhooks. For example:
   # 2:
   #   channelIds:
   #     - "insert_channel_id_to_mirror_here"
   #   webhookUrls:
   #     - "insert_destionation_webhook_url_here"
```
